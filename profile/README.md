# HoloTrade

**Decentralized | Zero-Trust | Copy Trading on Solana**

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **HoloTrade**, the first fully on-chain, non-custodial copy trading protocol on Solana. We empower traders by enabling permissionless trade replication with complete transparency and no intermediaries.

## What is HoloTrade?

HoloTrade is a decentralized protocol that allows users to automatically mirror trades from elite traders directly on-chain. Unlike traditional platforms, HoloTrade operates in a **zero-trust environment**, meaning:

- **No centralized custody** of user funds
- **No middlemen** — trades are mirrored through smart contracts owned by you
- **Complete transparency** — all activity is publicly verifiable on Solana
- **Scalability and speed** leveraging Solana’s high-performance blockchain

## Key Features

- **Non-custodial Architecture**: Funds always stay in your control.
- **Instant Trade Replication**: Ultra-fast execution with minimal latency.
- **Performance Tracking**: Transparent leaderboards and on-chain stats.
- **Modular Smart Contracts**: Built with Anchor for extensibility and auditability.
