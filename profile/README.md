# Holotrade

**Decentralized | Zero-Trust | Copy Trading on Solana**

We're the first fully non-custodial on-chain copy trading protocol every created with permissionless trade replication and complete transparency with no intermediaries.

## What is Holotrade

HoloTrade is a decentralized protocol that allows you to automatically mirror trades all directly on-chain. Unlike other traditional and crypto platforms, HoloTrade operates in a completely **zero-trust environment**, meaning:

- **No centralized custody**: All of your funds stay in your wallet
- **No middlemen**: Trades are mirrored via smart contracts owned by you
- **Complete transparency**: All activity is publicly verifiable on Solana
